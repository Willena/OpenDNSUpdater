OpenDNS updater
==============
OpenDNS Updater is an extremely easy to use android app to allow dynamic ip updates.
### Why this project ?
My personal use of this is to allow me to put a dns parental control by using openDNS definitions. As openDNS use the external ip address to apply the parental control,when connection are made outside your house, you need to update the ip address on openDNS servers. So this little app is made to update external ip address each time the android device is connected to a wifi network.
