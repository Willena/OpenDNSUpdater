### Quick presentation
OpenDNSUpdater is an extremely easy to use android app to perform dynamic IP updates.

### Presentation

OpenDns is a very famous DNS service used by a lot of people, but not everybody knows that they also provide some filtering product for individuals.

This type of service is free and can be very usefull to filter websites such as porn, phishing, malware, and many other category.

The service rely on your external IP to perform filter actions.

### Why an android application for a DNS service ?

As I said on the previous line, the service rely on your external IP address, so when you change access point or start using mobile data, you request will not be filtered.

Updater exist for almost all other platform such as Windows, Mac and Linux, but not for Android or IOS.
