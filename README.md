# OpenDnsUpdater

### Quick presentation
OpenDNSUpdater is an extremely easy to use android app to perform dynamic IP updates.

### Presentation

OpenDns is a very famous DNS service used by a lot of people, but not everybody knows that they also provide some filtering product for individuals.

This type of service is free and can be very usefull to filter websites such as porn, phishing, malware, and many other category.

The service rely on your external IP to perform filter actions.

### Why an android application for a DNS service ?

As I said on the previous line, the service rely on your external IP address, so when you change access point or start using mobile data, you request will not be filtered.

Updater exist for almost Windows, Mac and Linux, but not for Android or IOS.

### Why this project

I have litle sisters and brothers. They are still young but they already start to use computer, tablet, mobile phone and other electronic gadgets.

I thought about a way to block any website that could popup and chock them. I find out that OpenDNS way able to filter DNS request and return a fake page in case of a blocked website. It is simple to setup, One ip address and a bunch of selected category to allow and it was done.

But as I sais if you change from the home network to another network the protection does not apply anymore since OpenDNS rely on the public IP. I built this little app to allow me to keep any device "protected" at any moment .
